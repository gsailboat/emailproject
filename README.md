This React Project is an example of an email project. A JSON object is passed with some inital values.

## Available Scripts

To run either type ```npm start``` or ```yarn start```.

## Functionality

There are two main aspects of this app.
- To show exisiting emails. To view more of a particular email in the list, each is clickable and expand into a modal with more information.
- To add new emails. To add a new email, the create tab needs to be clicked and all fields have to be filled out. The time and other information is added to make it uniform with other objects in the JSON file.
